# Tissue [![License](https://poser.pugx.org/cleentfaar/tissue/license.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/cleentfaar/tissue)

A PHP library that scans your files for viruses. This is done by providing adapters to various scanning engines.
Currently, only ClamAV and PHP-ClamAV is supported, but support for other engines is underway.

### FAQ

**Q:** Why is there no adapter for [virusscanner here] yet?

**A:** I don't always have the time to make new stuff so if you would like to contribute adapters feel free to submit
an issue or an PR for it! Take a look at the [contributing guide](Resources/doc/contributing.md) for instructions, thanks!
